# M5 Listing Search Criteria + Scoring Rubric

**Purpose:** Turn dealbreakers into quick filters and provide a consistent 0–100 scoring rubric for comparing listings.

> How to use: (1) Apply **Must-Have Filters**. If any fail → **Reject**. (2) Score the remaining categories. (3) Note any **Red Flags** (may override score).

---

## 1) Must-Have Filters (Dealbreakers)

Mark each as **Pass/Fail**. Any **Fail** = do not pursue unless explicitly waived.

### Location / Access
- **Commute ceiling:** _≤ ____ minutes_ to __________ (primary destination) during typical hours.
- **All-season access:** Public/maintained road; no routine impassable issues.
- **Flood/wildfire risk:** Not in high-risk zone (or requires acceptable insurance + mitigation plan).

### Property / Lot / Privacy
- **Lot size minimum:** _≥ ____ acres_ (or equivalent privacy buffer).
- **Privacy baseline:** No direct rear-window-to-rear-window adjacency OR acceptable screening potential.

### Home Basics
- **Bedrooms:** _≥ _____.
- **Bathrooms:** _≥ ____ full_ (minimum functional requirement).
- **Garage/parking:** _At least ____-car_ garage or equivalent covered/secure parking.
- **Condition baseline:** No known structural/foundation failure; no active water intrusion; no severe mold.

### Connectivity
- **Internet availability:** Verified broadband option that supports at least _____ Mbps down / ____ Mbps up_ (wired cable/fiber preferred; reliable fixed wireless acceptable; **no** “maybe Starlink” without verification).

### Financial/Legal
- **Property taxes:** Estimated within budget: _≤ $____/yr_ (or _≤ ____%_ of target).
- **HOA:** Ideally none. If present: HOA fee _≤ $____/mo_ and rules acceptable (rentals, fencing, parking, exterior changes, etc.).
- **Title/permits:** No obvious unpermitted additions that would block financing/insurance.

## 2) Scoring Rubric (0–100)

Score each category using the guidance below. Use half points if needed.

### A) Location & Commute (0–25)
- **25:** Ideal area; commute well under target; convenient essentials (groceries, services) without feeling dense.
- **18–22:** Meets commute target; minor tradeoffs (traffic windows, slightly far from essentials).
- **10–17:** Barely within commute ceiling or logistics are annoying.
- **0–9:** Commute exceeds ceiling or access is problematic.

### B) Lot, Trees, Privacy & Outdoor Usability (0–20)
- **20:** Lot size comfortably above minimum; meaningful tree cover; strong privacy; good yard/garden potential.
- **14–18:** Meets minimum; some privacy; trees present but not lush.
- **7–13:** Small/awkward lot; privacy requires significant work.
- **0–6:** Below minimum or poor privacy with no realistic mitigation.

### C) Home Layout, Size & Livability (0–15)
- **15:** Layout “just works” for daily life; good flow; bedrooms/baths positioned well; storage.
- **10–13:** Mostly good; 1–2 compromises (tight kitchen, odd primary suite, etc.).
- **5–9:** Multiple compromises; would require changes to be comfortable.
- **0–4:** Functional mismatch.

### D) Condition / Systems / Renovation Load (0–15)
- **15:** Turnkey or minor cosmetic; roof/HVAC/plumbing/electrical in good shape; no water issues.
- **10–13:** Some updates needed but straightforward; systems mostly OK.
- **5–9:** Significant deferred maintenance; unclear system ages; likely multiple projects.
- **0–4:** Major issues likely (foundation, chronic water, widespread rot/mold).

### E) Financial Fit (Price, Taxes, Ongoing Costs) (0–15)
- **15:** Strong value; comfortable payment; taxes/insurance reasonable; low ongoing costs.
- **10–13:** Within budget; costs a bit higher but acceptable.
- **5–9:** Stretched; taxes/insurance/utility costs concerning.
- **0–4:** Not viable financially.

### F) HOA / Restrictions / Future Flexibility (0–5)
- **5:** No HOA or minimal/benign rules; high flexibility.
- **3–4:** HOA exists but acceptable; fees/rules manageable.
- **1–2:** Restrictive rules or fees create real friction.
- **0:** Unacceptable restrictions.

### G) Internet & Work-From-Home Reliability (0–5)
- **5:** Fiber/cable verified; strong reliability; good upload.
- **3–4:** Fixed wireless or cable with moderate upload; still workable.
- **1–2:** Marginal option; unverified; likely unstable.
- **0:** No acceptable service.

### H) “Bonus Fit” Amenities (0–5)
Examples: workshop space, basement, fireplace, good natural light, quiet, nearby trails/water, EV charging potential.
- **5:** Multiple bonuses that matter.
- **3–4:** At least one meaningful bonus.
- **1–2:** Minor extras only.
- **0:** None.

## 3) Red Flags (Investigate or Reject)

Any single item here can override score depending on severity.

### Property / Site
- In known floodplain or repeated water history; poor drainage; standing water.
- Significant road noise, train noise, or industrial/agricultural nuisance (odor/spray) not obvious in photos.
- Easements that materially reduce privacy/use (utility ROW through prime yard space).

### Structure / Moisture
- Foundation cracks with displacement; sloping floors with evidence of movement.
- Water staining, musty smell, visible mold, frequent dehumidifiers, fresh paint in suspicious areas.
- Roof at/near end-of-life with interior staining.

### Systems / Safety
- Knob-and-tube, unsafe electrical panels, widespread ungrounded wiring (financing/insurance risk).
- Septic issues or unknown age without inspection; well concerns (yield/quality) without test.

### Legal / Financial
- Unpermitted additions; non-conforming bedrooms/baths.
- HOA litigation/special assessments; rapidly rising dues.
- Taxes likely to reassess significantly upward after sale.

### Connectivity
- Listing claims “high-speed internet” without provider proof; “Starlink available” without clear viability.
