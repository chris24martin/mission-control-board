# m5_002 — Lender shortlist (Holly, MI area) + comparison template

> **Important:** published mortgage rates change daily and vary by credit score, down payment, property type, loan size, points, and lock period. The only apples-to-apples comparison is to request a **same-day Loan Estimate (LE)** scenario from each lender.

## What to ask each lender for (so quotes are comparable)
Use **one exact scenario** across all lenders:

- **Purpose:** Home purchase
- **Property:** Primary residence, single-family (or specify condo if relevant)
- **Location:** Holly, MI area (Oakland/Genesee/Livingston as applicable)
- **Loan type:** Conventional 30-year fixed (also ask if a 7/6 ARM is meaningfully better)
- **Down payment:** X% (use the number you intend; if unknown, ask for 5%, 10%, 20% options)
- **Credit:** “Excellent” / provide score range if comfortable
- **Lock period:** 30-day (and optionally 45-day)
- **Escrows:** Yes (taxes + insurance)

Ask them to reply with:
- Interest rate + APR
- Points/credits
- Lender/origination/underwriting/processing fees (itemized)
- Third-party estimates (appraisal, title, etc. — OK if estimated)
- Required timeline + expected close (e.g., 21/30/45 days)
- Pre-approval requirements (docs + hard pull vs soft pull)
- Communication model (single LO? text/email? evening/weekend availability?)

## Shortlist (5–8 lenders to price + stress-test)
Mix of **local credit unions/banks** (often low fees, relationship-based) and **high-volume online lenders** (fast process, competitive pricing at times).

| Lender | Type | Why it’s on the list | Rate/points/fees (fill from LE) | Timeline | Communication | Pre-approval requirements | Notes / watchouts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU)** | Local credit union (MI) | Strong local presence; CUs often have lower lender fees and solid servicing |  |  |  |  | Confirm: membership requirements; ask about lender credits vs points |
| **Michigan State University Federal Credit Union (MSUFCU)** | Local credit union (MI) | Large CU with mortgage offering; potentially competitive fees |  |  |  |  | Ask whether they service loans or sell; confirm appraisal turn times |
| **Zeal Credit Union** | Local credit union (Metro Detroit) | CU option with branches; good to compare against other CUs |  |  |  |  | Their public “rates” page is mostly deposits/auto; request mortgage LE quote |
| **Huntington Bank** | Regional bank | Common in MI; good baseline for bank pricing and process |  |  |  |  | Ask about closing cost credits and any relationship discounts |
| **Flagstar Bank** | Bank (MI roots) | MI footprint; useful local bank comparator |  |  |  |  | Some pages are Cloudflare-protected; get LE via LO directly |
| **Rocket Mortgage** | Online/direct | Fast digital flow; common in MI; great “benchmark” LE |  |  |  |  | Often quick pre-approval; ensure fees are itemized and comparable |
| **Better Mortgage** | Online/direct | Fee structure can be competitive; good second online benchmark |  |  |  |  | Ask about underwriting speed and how they handle rural/unique properties |
| **Rate (formerly Guaranteed Rate)** | National lender | High volume; has “same day” marketing—good to test timeline |  |  |  |  | Confirm whether they can hit your desired close date reliably |

### Optional add (if you want an 8th/9th quote)
- **Local mortgage broker (independent)** serving Oakland/Genesee/Livingston: brokers can price multiple wholesale lenders (often very competitive). If you want, I can pull 3–5 highly reviewed brokers near Holly and add them as a separate table.

## Suggested “top 2” to start with (before you have LEs)
Until we have apples-to-apples Loan Estimates, these are the two I’d start with to get fast benchmark quotes:

1) **One local credit union:** **LMCU or MSUFCU** (whichever is easier to reach quickly)
2) **One online benchmark:** **Rocket Mortgage** (fast turn, very comparable documentation)

Once you receive 2–3 LEs, we can pick the true top two based on **APR + total lender fees + execution confidence**.

### Email (request for pre-approval + pricing)
Subject: Mortgage pre-approval + Loan Estimate quote request (home purchase, Holly MI)

Hi [Name],

I’m buying a primary residence in the Holly, MI area and would like to get pre-approved and compare pricing. Could you provide a Loan Estimate (or equivalent itemized quote) for this scenario:

- Purchase: primary residence (single-family)
- Loan: conventional 30-year fixed
- Down payment: [X%] (if possible also show 5% / 10% / 20%)
- Credit score range: [optional]
- Lock: 30-day (and 45-day if materially different)
- Escrows: yes

Please include:
- Rate + APR
- Points or lender credits
- Itemized lender fees (origination/underwriting/processing)
- Expected timeline to close (21/30/45 days)
- What you need from me to issue a pre-approval letter (docs + soft/hard credit pull)

If there’s a best time to talk, I can do a quick call.

Thanks,
Chris

### Phone script (2–3 minutes)
- “I’m buying a primary residence near Holly, MI and want to compare 2–3 lenders quickly.”
- “Can you send me an itemized Loan Estimate-style quote for a conventional 30-year fixed with [X%] down and a 30-day lock?”
- “What are your lender fees (origination/underwriting/processing)?”
- “How fast can you close right now (typical days)?”
- “Do you do pre-approval with a soft pull first, or do you require a hard pull?”
- “Will I have one loan officer I can text/email, including evenings/weekends?”

## Decision rule (simple)
When you have LEs, rank lenders by:
1) **APR** (ties broken by)
2) **Total lender fees + points** (net of credits)
3) **Confidence they can close on time** (responsiveness + clear process)

---

If you send me the first 1–2 Loan Estimates you receive (redact account #s), I can normalize them into a clean comparison and recommend the true top 2.
