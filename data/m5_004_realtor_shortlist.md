### Notes / caveats
- I prioritized candidates with **direct contact info available from first-party sources** (brokerage site / MLS directory / BHHS directory). Some other “top agent” lists (Yelp/Zillow/HomeLight) are fine for discovery but not ideal as the canonical contact record.
- If you want a *tighter* radius (Holly + Fenton + Grand Blanc only), we can swap out the Brighton candidate for another Holly/Fenton-specific agent.

## Interview questions (copy/paste)

### 1) Local expertise (Holly + wooded/secluded lots)
1. In the last 12 months, how many **Holly/Fenton/Grand Blanc/Clarkston** area transactions have you closed (buy-side specifically)?
2. How often do you work with **wooded lots / acreage / private drives**? Any common pitfalls you watch for?
3. What micro-areas would you recommend for **yard + trees + privacy** without getting into “problem” properties?
4. For wooded lots: what are your top “site” checks (drainage, slope, easements, wetlands, driveway access, etc.)?

### 2) Negotiation & offer strategy
5. How do you decide between: price vs appraisal-gap coverage vs inspection structure vs closing timeline?
6. What’s your approach to **multiple-offer situations**?
7. Do you recommend **escalation clauses**? When do you avoid them?
8. Describe a negotiation you’re proud of (inspection repairs, appraisal issues, low inventory).

### 3) Availability & process
9. What’s your typical response time (text/call/email)?
10. If a good listing hits on a Thursday night, can we tour within 24–48 hours?
11. Do you personally attend showings, or do you use showing agents? (If team: who will I actually be working with?)
12. How do you keep clients from “panic-buying”? What does your decision framework look like?

### 4) Vendor network (lenders/inspectors/well/septic/tree/drainage)
13. Who are your go-to **inspectors** (general + septic + well + radon + structural)?
14. Do you have vendors for **septic/well** and **drainage** evaluations?
15. Any preferred lenders? (And do you get materially better coordination with them, or is it just familiarity?)

### 5) First-time buyer fit + working agreement
16. Do you require an exclusive buyer agency agreement? What term length and how do you handle “exit” if it’s not working?
17. What are your expectations of me as the buyer (pre-approval, proof of funds, timeline)?
18. How do you educate first-time buyers on inspection findings and what’s “normal” vs a dealbreaker?

### 6) “Wooded/secluded property” red flags (tell me the truth)
19. What are the top 5 red flags you see in secluded listings around here?
20. When would you tell a buyer to walk away even if they love the house?

## Suggested next step (low-friction)
1. Pick **3 interviews** to start (I’d do: **Brokaw**, **Full Circle agent**, **BHHS Jane Murphy**).
2. Use the questions above; record answers in a quick scorecard.
3. After the calls, choose 1 agent for an initial **working agreement**.
